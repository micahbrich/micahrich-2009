<div id="story"> 
  <p>once upon a time, there was a boy.</p> 
  <p>his called himself micah, and he was exactly twenty-three years old 
on 
his 23<sup>rd</sup> birthday. he lived all over the place â€“ 
sometimes new york, one time in boston, and sometimes in sunny california. he liked to think of moving around like an adventure.</p> 
  <p>on the first day of the first month of the year 2009, he and <a href="http://www.hadilaksono.com">his friend caroline</a> started working as <a href="http://www.weareagoodcompany.com">A Good Company</a>, so that they could play and have fun all the time. they still do to this very day.</p> 
  <p>sometimes, micah played <a href="http://www.micahplaysguitar.com">guitar</a>, writing songs and singing them. he liked it, but didn't do it enough. he vowed that this would change.</p> 
  <p>and on every single day, except, of course, for the days in which he did not, micah wrote down what happened to him in a very secret <a href="http://www.micahrich.com/blog/">journal</a>. he'd take photographs, too, and only his most precious of friends were allowed to read it and see them.</p> 
  
  <p>then one day, micah decided it wasn't enough. he wanted to share fun links and talk to his pals! so he found a little bird that would <a href="http://www.twitter.com/micahbrich">"tweet, tweet!"</a> and tell everyone what he was doing! oh, that bird sure was a rascal, but he and micah grew to be good friends.</p> 
  
  <p>and that's the whole story. micah never grew up, and never stopped playing. to this day, micah sings songs and makes websites; to this day micah moves around and whispers to his bird-friends. to this day, micah is a happy little guy.</p> 
 
  <p>the end.</p>
